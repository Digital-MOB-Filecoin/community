## Project Name: FILPoll

## Category
Application

## Project Description
FilPoll is a Filecoin community polling tool for gauging community sentiment on Filecoin Improvement Proposals.

It can tally poll results based on a user's FIL token holdings, a miner's storage mining power, or the addresses of verified core developers, app developers, or ecosystem collaborator organizations, or the amount stored by storage clients. All poll results are saved to Textile Buckets on IPFS so they can be audited later on.

Note that this is a community polling tool to survey what the community thinks, not an official community voting tool for FIPs.

## Project Status
The project is currently in beta release.
